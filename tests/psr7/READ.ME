Pvc just passes through each of the methods to GuzzleHttp.  The only purpose behind doing so is to centralize
pvc's implementation of Http client, request and response so that if, for some reason, you want to use something
other than Guzzle, you can do so easily.  The uri object is similar but uses the League's Uri object under the covers
